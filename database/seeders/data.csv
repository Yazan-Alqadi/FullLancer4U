Earn Up to $1600 Month Writing for Survival/Outdoors Blog | $3 per 100 words | 400 Word Trial Offer,"Looking to pay a writer up to $400+ a week to write content for either my survival or outdoors blog at a rate of $3 per 100 words (3¢ per word).

The first job offer will be for the first 400 words of an article and I'll hire you for the other 1000+ words if you write the first 400 good. This way I can see your writing skill and how you follow guidelines. If you accept the job I'll let you know how I like my blog articles written and you can decide if you want to accept or not.

All articles will be informational posts only.

For example, I may give you the keyword ""how to survive a bear attack"" and you'll have to write a 1,000+ word blog article on the subject. I expect you to research the topic thoroughly so you can be as helpful as possible to the reader.

Make sure to write pineapple at the beginning of your message to let me know you read the job offer all the way through.

Look forward to hearing from you!

P.S. My total monthly spending is $1600+ but I'll be hiring multiple writers to fulfill my content needs. This means it's unlikely for you to make the total amount unless you're an exceptional writer who can write 53,000+ words a month. So I guess it's technically possible, just highly unlikely.",48

Heat map of self storage supply and demand,"To start: I am trying to answer the question - ""Where should I buy land to build a self-storage facility?""

I am looking for a heatmap style visualization of current self storage facility supply and demand. To start, you can keep this relative to the state of Pennsylvania, USA.

This may be a tough project that will require several bits of data and the ability to convert that data into a heat map. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a tool that will allow me to find areas of land that have high population density but low amount of self storage facilities.

You will need to find/create:
1. A list of ALL self storage facilities
2. An accurate estimate of square footage per facility. (This can be done manually by measuring the length/width on Google Maps satellite. View, however, this method is not accurate for two story facilities or facilities that are located inside of other buildings that you can not easily measure the amount of storage square footage by looking at the building footprint. )
3. From 1. and 2. you can build a heatmap of self storage facility square footage density.
4. A heatmap of population density.
5. Finally from the previous data sets generate the final ""self storage square foot per capita"" heatmap.



Could you kindly answer the following questions:
What skills will you require to perform this job?
What is the budget for the job?
Where will you pull you data?

Thanks!

"Optimize Ubuntu Server for osm, carto, mapnik rendering ","We have an Ubuntu dedicated root server with
Intel Xeon E5 2630v4 10 x 2.20 GHz
256GB
2TB SSD

So actually enough power.

We have created 10 styles on carto that need to be rendered on our server. For this we use the batch render process rendered.
As an example
render_list --map=blueprint -a -z 5 -Z 17 --num-threads=4 --max-load=9999999

Unfortunately our render process stops every time after about 15 -20 minutes.

I need a talented and dependable NATIVE ENGLISH (only!) writer to write about digital marketing technology (apps, digital menus, automation services, etc). This will be mostly B2B content. We are looking for someone with experience and solid writing skills.

We intend for this to be a very long term relationship. We need someone who is ready to be reliable on a weekly basis.

The ideal candidate should be available to write one to two articles per week of around 1000 words.

We may have other topics for you if you want to take on additional work.

The test article will be paid as long as it's good enough to publish after some editing!

Provide links to your work in your proposal please!

Feel free to ask questions if you have any.

Looking forward to potentially working with you!

Doesn't have to use Signal but maintaining consistency in animation curves is important. Also using a rudimentary character rig and Mixamo for FBX animations, so familiarity with these is a plus.

Short API code for Twilio and Zoho,"Referrence Zoho Cliq status of 2 agents via API. RESTF API Documentation here https://www.zoho.com/cliq/help/restapi/v2/#retrieve-current-status

I have a twimlet setup in Twilio Studio that calls to 2 cell phones before being forwarded to voicemail if no answer. I would like an api call to Zoho Cliq to see current status of these 2 agents before proceeding to twimlet. If either agent status is set to ""Do Not Disturb"", I would like to reference a different twimlet that does not include that number.

I can have alternative twimlets already in studio, just need to link to appropriate twimlet based on Zoho Cliq status of ""Do Not Disturb""

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional offer if interested. This would be before sending to mobile numbers.

Need call sent to alternative number if status in Zoho Phonebridge is ""Available"".  This would be based off zoho phonebridge api.  If status is available, attempt to call to twilio number associated with Zoho CRM. If there is no answer at the zoho CRM, call would be directed to voicemail number (which is number associated with Zoho Desk). Call cannot end at zoho crm if not answered.

This is a more advanced setup in twilio and not a requirement for listing. Only needed if this is something you would like to attempt.

This is the flow.
Inbound call to twilio. Route to zoho crm if phone bridge status available.
If no answer or unavailable, route to mobile numbers via twimlet based on available status.
Finally, route to Zoho Desk number that is used as voicemail box.",42

Vector tiles to raster tiles: display high detailed OSM: map tiles / Mapbox / Node / AWS Developer,"We are currently building a website called mapnique.com - it serves designed interactive maps (which can be found here: https://florian-maps.netlify.app/ ) that you can print on posters. We worked with a special developer for the maps before and already thought we could launch until we realized a huge bug: we render vector tiles but because of the high detail level it loads too much data and then crashes on mobile. Therefore we need to serve a Raster tiles version.

For this particular thing, there was no frameworks. It is just Node.js, Shell, AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3), Mapbox GL JS a bit, and, importantly, for map tiles generation I use Osmium + OSM and Tippecanoe. To make our own self-hosted general topographic content I would propose to use OpenMapTiles schema - would be good if you already had an experience with that

But, the general overarching task - to make raster .png map tiles from vector .pbf map tiles + Mapbox GL JS Stylesheet which is in .json format.

Possibly, there will be someone knowing how to do it in a different more efficient way. The best would be if we can render raster tiles from vector tiles on-the-fly - then we would not need to rerender everything, etc.

The former developer is not available for longterm work anymore. We are therefore looking for a longterm partner who can help us here and with future adjustments.

The former developer would still be reachable for questions of course.

Product Roadmap Ecommerce + Crypto integrations ,"Hello! our company is United Market which is a mobile and web app coming out this month. We are looking to add e-commerce to our platform, for digital goods. We are focused on the music industry and would like to add an additional vertical to our platform by allowing our users to sell digital audio files(beats and drum kits) we would like you to analyze our competitors such as beatstars.com and in DEEP detail describe their flows an features. So that we can provide this document to our Development team to implement in our platform. We need someone with coding knowledge so they can explain it in the best language, that our development team will be able to understand and implement. We also, are looking to integrate cryptocurrency as a payment option in our platform, so we need a detailed description of the most efficient way to add this into our platform as well. We currently are using stripe.

So the main points is to write out a analysis of beatstars.com  (which is a beat marketplace) and their features on how they execute the selling of audio files, displaying and how they handle the specific document(agreements) that correlate with the audio files while purchasing. In short, our development after reading your document should be able to get to work immediately. There is also another platform known as sellfy.com which should also be looked into and analyzed as they allow for the selling of digital goods as well to.


So the main take aways should Be to analyze beatstars and sellfy feature set and explain the run down of the platform and how the flows an features work. Also, to research and deeply explain the best way to integrate cryptocurrency transactions into our platform(people can pay with crypto)

You also are to research software that exist ALREADY that we could integrate into our platform to add the E-commerce marketplace feel or crypto currency payment acceptance that we may just have to pay for but would save us tremendous development time as we would just be integrating it into our current code.

Create parking maps,"My company works with residential buildings to manage their parking. Many times, we are given maps of the parking spot numbers and parking spot levels/areas at these buildings, and they are very hard to read.

Growing Agency Seeking Proactive Facebook Media Buyer,"Vybe Media is looking for an expert-level Facebook media buyer to join our fast-growing team.

We believe in delivering a world-class service to our clients without working ourselves to death.

Led by a former United States Army Green Beret, our company believes in working until the mission is complete, and not a minute longer. You'll be led with clear guidance and expectations, but how the mission is accomplished is up to you. Working with us will turn you into the best version of yourself, and pay you well for your contribution.

You can find our company values here:
https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/eUzA1H8B1prrsfjQ4zmxHDRb

We've almost tripled in revenue in the last few months, and we're looking for our next rockstar team member to help us triple it again!

Your work will be fully remote, and you're free to work on your own schedule, as long as you can satisfy the meeting requirements (details below).

Your sole responsibility is launching, optimizing, and scaling Facebook ad campaigns.

We have a Creative Strategist to support you with new images/videos (though your input and new ideas are HIGHLY encouraged), a Senior Strategist to take care of communicating with clients, and a Creative Director to help improve the business as a whole, making it even easier to succeed with paid ads.

Your first 7 days will strictly be onboarding, and getting familiar with our team, our systems, our clients, your role, and our expectations for you.

After that, you'll be up and running inside client accounts, and helping us change the lives of our clients by crushing their revenue and growth goals.

As an added benefit, you'll regularly get access to new courses/training for FREE to help you stay on top of the latest changes and best practices.

At Vybe Media, all we care about is results, and working as little as possible.

We're constantly optimizing our workflows and systems to get more done in less time, because - let's face it - the point of life isn't to work.

We push ourselves to the max when it's required, and then develop systems and processes to make sure we don't have our back against the wall very often.

Here's the person we're looking for:
- Someone who is PROACTIVE. If you see a problem, fix it. If you don't know how, figure it out. If you can't, ask for help. Ignorance is acceptable, inaction is not.

- Someone who takes OWNERSHIP. We will give you very clear guidance on the client's goals and target KPI's. Our ideal person will take those numbers and OWN them, not waiting for someone else to tell them how to improve performance, or revive a struggling account.

- Someone with proven STRATEGIES. You should be able to explain at least 3 different media buying strategies that have worked for you previously, and when you might use them again. We need you to know what to do when things aren't working as planned.

- Someone who is DATA-DRIVEN. You should know the industry standards for CPC, CTR,  ATC %, Purchase %, etc., and you should be able to come up with ideas for improving any of these numbers. We'll support you with new copy, images, landing pages, etc - but we'll be looking for your input on where things are broken, and some possible reasons why.

- Someone who is EXPERIENCED. If you haven't failed on a client account before, you're probably not a good fit. No one wins 100% of the time, and losing can be the best education. You should be just as comfortable managing $100k/month+ as you are managing $3k/month. If you've never wanted to throw your laptop in the trash, or punch Zuck in the face - you haven't been doing this long enough.

- Someone who is HUNGRY. If you aren't dying to add 5-6 new accounts to your day, please don't apply. We're looking for someone who's ready to get after it. Someone who's ready to find out just what they're capable of, and push themselves to the limit.

While we're looking to hire someone in the next 7 days, know that we're going to vet you thoroughly.

The following will get you immediately disqualified:
- Failure to follow instructions as laid out below
- Failure to show up to any appointments/calls
- Reaching out to anyone on our team outside of UpWork

In your cover letter, please include the following:
- Tell us about a time where you demonstrated a proactive attitude instead of waiting for guidance.
- Tell us about a time where a client was unhappy, and you took ownership of the results.
- Tell us about a time where you worked with minimal guidance and achieved solid results
- Tell us what's wrong with each of the following sets of metrics:
(CTR All 10%, CTR Link 1%, CPC $8, ATC % 15%, Pur % 4.5%)
(CTR All 2%, CTR Link 1%, CPC $2, Opt-In % 12%, Pur % 2.5%)
(CTR All 5%, CTR Link 2.5%, CPC $1.50, Opt-In 40%, Lead to Call % 5%)

We look forward to hearing from you, and adding you to our team!

1. The user will upload the image of the map
2. The app will display the map
3. The user will click on the map to create points and enter their latitude and longitude.
4. The user will then enter a latitude and longitude of an unknown point.
5. The app will use the lat/lngs of the created points to calculate where the unknown point is located on the map image. It will display a marker on that spot.
5a. Instead of entering lat/lng to search for an unknown point, the user can also enter the address which will then be geocoded to lat/lng.

That's everything the app needs to do. I'm not sure if it needs much of a backend. The images and markers don't need to be saved so no storage or database is needed.

Please let me know what questions you have.

Thanks!

Need a C# ASP developer to develop a web portal based on google or open street map,"I need a web portal in .net that will have a google map or open street map on a side and will display a live video stream on the right.
This is a real-time web portal and we have to display multiple pointers on the map and change its color based on real-time data received via TCP or MQTT or HTTP.
On the map, the admin can add pointers (select icon or shape to be displayed) on the map. After entering settings like name, location name, connect type, connection details the data will be saved into the database along with GPS coordinates automatically fetched.
When the user will log in, all these pointers will be displayed on the map. the software will connect with all the connection strings (TCP, APIs, or MQTT) and listen to status data being received.
For example, if the admin will add a pointer, and enter connection details as IP: 192.168.1.1 port:1234, then the software will continuously listen to this IP and port and display a red or green color icon. If software receives the red message, a red icon will be displayed and alert sound will be played.

"Help w/ iOS .net app + react website. Must have experience with maps, Instagram, weather api’s","SURFERforecast Refresh

V2.0 – Stabilize and Upgrade backend of forecast.surfer.com and maps.surfer.com backend (Dot Net + Native ios + native android platform).  I am constantly needing to reboot the EC2 instances.

Resolution:
-Stabilize the .net backend and create new user management portal
• Create new backend CMS to manage users
• Move to a less expensive tier of AWS RDS or another database that is less expensive monthly
• Export all login users and passwords to the new backend CMS (TBD)
• Stabilize all
• The AWS instance keeps timing out, please take a look at the backend and help fix the reason why it keeps timing out.

*Considerations:
• Will need to update Stripe, Google Analytics, Mailchimp, Revenuecat, etc
• Will the ios/android apps - need to stabilize


V3.0 Map Upgrades

3.1) We need to update the images on the (Southern California) react + leaflet maps so that the maps will have higher resolution images. There will be new images (tiles) from AWS s3 to be shown when a user zooms all the way into the screen in these geolocations. See screenshot


3.2) ​Add Maps for other regions:
*best source for each new region is tbd
Options: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/marine/
https://www.usno.navy.mil/FNMOC
https://stormglass.io

Additional Maps (Add to the maps.surfer.com website)
- Mexico (Will have S3 tiles for this region)
- East Coast
- Caribbean
- South American
- Europe
- Pacific Ocean
- Indonesia


Considerations for other new region maps:
* We need to restrict users to see 3 days of free forecasts, beyond that they will need to login and subscribe to access the forecasts via stripe
* Need to make sure these maps have SEO and receive search traffic



V4.0 – design / new re-imagined a version of the Forecast.Surfer.com Graphs, Favorites and Alerts, Social Feeds
This could be ios/android only (depending on cost)?

4.1) – Graphs iOS/android and forecast.surfer.com
**Need to be simple and engaging. Example: meetcarrot.com/weather/
Update the graph view of the forecast
a. The “Day” view needs to be more simple and clean.
b. The layout should be “simple “, ie a user can quickly view simple forecast, referencing average data for 1am-6am, 7am-12pm, 1pm-6pm, 7pm-12am
c. Simple chart and numerical values. User can then swipe to future/past days
d. Example: Carrot Weather, goepic.surf/  or Surfline.com


4.2 Favorites:  Users need an option to favorite a spot or region. *This is currently working in the forecast.surfer.com product and ios/android apps.  We will need to recreate this feature in the new experience. *Add “favorite” option/button to maps.surfer view
Example of current view that needs to be updated (screenshots to follow)


4.3 Alerts functionality (needs to be updated).
*This feature has been a high ask for our users
The alerts should stay active until a user turns them off for a spot. *Ie, once a user sets an alert for a spot, the alert will stay active to listen for future days where conditions align to their specifications. This should be a small change in the code to fix. Alerts work already, they should just stay active until a user modifies or turns them off.
*Add alert icon to maps.surfer
* Show alerts % relative to forecast icon on the maps timeline

Examples of current view on the live app  to follow) They will need to be updated or recreated


4.4 Social feeds (The “social feeds” should be almost ready to go live in the bitbucket code.  There will be Instagram galleries for each surf spot from the flockler API.   **We will need to talk through this if there are any issues with Flockler.

*The social posts from that spot will reference the “timestamp” of that images post date. When a user looks at that image, they will see the surf, wind, etc conditions from that date/time.  (From Stormglass api)
*A user will be prompted to set an alert to listen to when these conditions may happen in the future.  *A user can modify the alert settings, since the social post may not have the exact parameters for an alert.





V5.0  iOS/Android Updates
Add maps from maps.surfer.com to ios/android mobile apps
a. Add map icon in the mobile app bottom nav (will send map icon)
b. Relaunch new ios/android apps with graphs and maps above
c. Add paid option on ios/android apps to see the maps. (use the same 3 days free and the other days paid as we have on maps.surfer.com)
d. Add Revenuecat to ios/android apps to sync payment/account tracking with maps.surfer.com",42

Move from pandas_udf to RDD + mappartitions,"I need assistance of a Data Engineer.
My team is working on a product value calculation model. I’ve got local working code, which creates DataFrame from Hive-Tables and then goes through a features transformation model and scores according to three models (one model for one pair of products (base product and secondary product)) and with the final formula it calculates the required values.
We found out that we cannot use the current version of the code because it uses a lot of pandas_UDF (SPARK 2.4), but we have to use SPARK 2.2. So I have to rewrite the current code to adapt to the structure of RDD using mappartitions. This code has to launch with spark2_submit, so it is expected to be more or less optimized. During the analysis of the code, I found a large number of eval/exec. Those are not acceptable because of security reasons and have to be replaced.

So the task is this:
1) move from pandas_udf to RDD + mappartitions (since we cannot change PKL file, then it looks like there has to be a DF -- RDD -- DF change).
2) get rid of eval/exec.
3) this code will work in a cluster with the spark2_submit.

In the attachment there is an example of one of the classes that need to be adapted according to the conditions.",51

Get Paid to Study Anatomy - Assistance Writing Anatomy Questions for Student Resource,"Hi there! My name is Chris and I'm a junior doctor currently compiling an anatomy question bank for  medical students I tutor. Currently my question bank is around 800 questions long, with references to our core textbook, and detailed explanations for more of the questions.

We will be willing to pay for your hourly contributions (as a guide we would expect you're able to produce anywhere from 5 to 15 or so questions per hour - however we expect this will vary based on content complexity).

The questions will be used for medical students, junior doctors and trainees (from an undergraduate to postgraduate level).

We also hope to add pathology/physiology resources in future

I'm after your help in expanding my question bank, so I can help more students.

Don't worry if you have no anatomy expertise - my questions are inspired by paraphrasing/referencing our core surgical anatomy textbook, which will obviously be provided by virtue of a free, common use PDF file upon acceptance of this job.

I'm willing to offer your a fee per question, after a short 5 question trial, to ensure we're the right fit for each other.

What the Job Involves:
- Reading a paragraph/ section of the anatomy textbook to be provided (written in English)
- Write a question with:
   - Statement/ broad question
   - Followed by four true/ false stem questions, numbered 1 to 4, relating to the topic, with false answers marked
       - Each of this type of question can have any combination of true or false responses (i.e. true/false/false/false; true/false/true/false, etc...)
   - Reference included in the question to the exact page from the book that the topic can be located (just a page is fine).
   - Short explanation based upon the text is useful, but not mandatory for all questions - this need not be detailed, but can be short (paraphrased) excerpts from the text.

Alternatively, questions can also be a short statement, with five options and only one correct answer (one of A-E). An example of this type of question is seen in example 2.

========

[Example 1 ]
182.
The Pronator teres: p87
1. Is a muscle of the deep flexor group of the forearm [True]
2. Receives innervation from the ulnar nerve [True]
3. Comprises two heads, which entrap a terminal branch of the brachial plexus [False]
4. Is deep to the radial artery [False]

Pronator teres features in the superficial flexor group of the forearm. It comprises two heads (humeral and ulnar heads), with the radial artery superficial to the humeral head, median nerve sandwiched between both heads and the ulnar artery deep to the ulnar head.

It is innervated by the highest muscular branch of the median nerve (C6,7 roots specifically).

Of note, the median nerve may give proximal innervation to the pronator teres, in which case it may be said to occasionally therefore have an innervation of a muscle in the arm.

========

[Example 2]
144.
Which structure pierces the lateral intermuscular septum of the arm? p80
A. profunda brachii artery
B. brachial artery
C. ulnar collateral artery
D. median nerve
E. ulnar nerve

The lateral intermuscular septum is pierced by the radial nerve (C5,6,7,8,T1) which is derived from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, as well as the profunda brachii artery (anterior descending branch). It provides attachment for the medial head of the triceps (posterior to the septum), as well as the extensor carpi radialis longus and brachioradialis (anterior to the septum).

=======
Note both questions are equally valid and both will be remunerated equally!

What I'm looking for:
- Good handle of English is essential - needs to be able to interpret the provided surgical anatomy textbook. I'll be proofreading each question personally, but if correcting mistakes takes longer than it would take for me to write a question myself, then this job mightn't be a good fit for you.
- Creativity - making questions can be time consuming, and keeping my students interest is of paramount importance. Hence you'd ideally need to be versatile in mixing up the order of correct answers/ ways of phrasing each question.

I appreciate it can be difficult to determine what's important to include in a question, particularly if you're not medical, however the book provided does a good job of signposting the important bits.

Finally, you'd need to be willing to surrender the IP rights to written works so that they can be disseminated amongst the medical students I tutor in and around my city.

I'm happy to discuss any element of this job further if it's of interest to you! Thanks for taking the time to read my brief.

Have a great day and stay safe.",52

Add zoom/pan/click functionality to a D3 map (JS+HTML+CSS & Bootstrap 5.0),"I have a simple, single-page site built in HTML, CSS and JS and hosted on an AWS S3 bucket. I have it almost completely built, but there a few technicalities with which I need assistance.

The site contains a D3 TopoJSON U.S. county map with data interactivity. The following issues are outstanding:

1. Map zooms in on double-click but it is not easy to zoom out, zoom does not necessarily work on mobile, and pan can move the map out of view entirely.
2. The divs and styling for the map do not appear to render size properly on Safari, Opera, IE... they work well on Chrome and Firefox.
3. I would like to add zoom in/ zoom out/ reset buttons that apply the functionality from 1.
4. I would like to refactor the code for populating the legend, so that moves/resizes automatically on window drag (these work correctly if you click from within a window, but if you click then drag the window size, the divs break down).
5. Related to 4, I would like the legend text to resize automatically to fit and never overflow.
6. If possible, I would like to animate the transitions of the map and legend divs when the legend div appears on county click.
7. There appear to be minor issues in Open Graph metadata tags such that the image does not appear in iMessage, and there are issues with it on Facebook and LinkedIn.

I do not anticipate these fixes will involve much time or labor for a skilled D3/web design specialist.

Then dumps files into CSV format, or into google sheets - I'd prefer google sheets but maybe this complicates/costs too much time for me to pay for Idk.

Interactive PowerBI-Dashboard for visualizing Business Capabilities (hierarchical map of boxes),"I need an interactive and appealing visual presentation of Business Capabilities within PowerBI. Business Capabilities describe the high-level abilities of a company (represented by boxes) that are structured in a hierarchical order and can have multiple levels (depth). Attached, you find a screenshot of a static PowerPoint implementation that shows you exactly what I need. This map contains three levels of capabilities (e.g. level 1: ""Strategic Management""; level 2: ""Strategy Development""; level 3: ""Define Strategy""). The maximum number of levels should not exceed 5.

I would be glad if the visual representation within PowerBI is as close to the given one as possible. But I am also open to other visual representations or other Microsoft tools (MS Visio?) if necessary.

I have the following functional requirements for the interactive Dashboard:
The business capabilities will be stored/edited in a table structure (Name, ID, parent-child-relation, probably further data fields later...). This table must be imported and interpreted by PowerBI, so that no manual editing of the map is necessary if further capabilities are added, removed, or relocated. Please provide a corresponding Excel table with dummy data for this dashboard.
I need a slicer feature, to filter or highlight capabilities based on their properties. E.g. I want to annotate capabilities regarding high criticality and low criticality. I want to be able to have a slicer element to highlight respectively fade-out/grey-out filtered capabilities in the dashboard. The same should be possible for continuous values (e.g. a heatmap based on properties within a range of 0-100).
As in the given PPT example, I want to be able to define the style/color of the capabilities within the source table. This is for a higher visual appeal towards the audience.

Tool to fast migrate VM,"Hi guys,

In my work I have a lot of Linux servers to migrate from one provider to another one. Often I've no access to the hypervisor from the source datacenter so I was wondering if it's possible to develop a tool similar to the r1soft (but this noe is designer only for backup needs)

There's already some modules to do it (llvm or dm-era) (https://www.cloudandheat.com/block-level-data-tracking-using-davice-mappers-dm-era/) but I can't change the working configuration of the source file system.
- Deploy a VM with the same disks configuration on a target infrastructure
- Sync the changed sectors between the 2 servers (with the exception of course of swap, logical devices and the IP con that should be custom)
- When the cue is almost 0...turn off the first server and turn on the second one.

Develop custom map poster creator app for existing Shopify store using Mapbox/Leaflet ,"We are looking for a developer who can bring our webshop to the next level by developing a custom map poster creator app for our Shopify store (www.earthart.nl). Currently we sell maps, satellite images and aerial images as wall decoration, but all of them are designed by us. We now want to give our customers control over the layout and mapstyle of their poster. To give you a bit of an idea of what we are looking for hereby two well known example stores: https://www.mapify.cc/editor/create and  https://eu.grafomap.com/editor.
Of course ours will be different in both style and content.

You will develop both frontend and backend of the custom map poster creator. The used library for the map design is open for discussion, but with a preference for Leaflet over Mapbox as it's Open Source.

Frontend:
(1) Visualize and update the poster based on the changes the customer makes (see below)
(2) Enter a city/address in search bar and zoom to extent of location in the map
(3) Select map style from pre-sets. Draft styles have already been created in Mapbox Studio by us that you can use. At least two styles will be based on WMS.
(4) Select the layout of the poster from pre-sets, such as the location of text/labels, frames around map, map in shape of circle/house/key etc. These layouts need to be developed by you. Expect around 8 styles, and input is provided by us.
(5) Add an icon on the map, such as a house, hart, or location icon.
(6) Change map orientation (portrait, landscape)
(7) Personalize titles and subtitles
(8) Select materials (poster, dibond, acrylglass)
(9) Select size (which differ per material). Update preview of the map after size has been changed.
(10) Select hanging systems for certain materials
(11) Update prices based on chosen material, size and options
(12) Administrator (me) should preferably have the possibility to generate maps without creating an order (we like to use the tool to design a map of for example New York and add it as a standard product or for marketing purposes)
(13) Work well on desktop, tablet and smartphone. On Smartphone the map should stay visible as much as possible, so no endless scrolling up and down to see the effect of a change on the map. We prefer a tab/step system that guides the customer through the options.

Backend
(1) Generate an order from the custom designed map, store the order in Shopify and let the customer pay (can use existing checkout and paying options).
(2) Generate high resolution image file of exact layout of the map as designed by the customer which will be used to print the poster
(3) Add additional materials, sizes and hanging systems
(4)  Adjust prices
(5) Add new map styles from for example Mapbox Studio or WMS to be used by customers on Frontend.

Optional
(1) Create a map with a route (for example flights from city to city, or a road trip)

(2) Besides the styles we currently have in Mapbox Studio and a few WMS styles we are also considering to create and host our own tileserver with mapstyles. We might do this part by our own, but if you have experience with Linux VPS, PostGIS, Geoserver, maptiler, and Openstreetmap/Mapnik you might contribute to this part as well. This is probably more something for the second half of 2022, but we would like to continue working with one freelancer if possible.

Budget: We realize this is not a small project, but we are a small startup with limited personal resources. We prefer to agree on a fixed price, but that's open for discussion.
Timeline: No high time pressure. If spreading work over longer time reduces costs than that is preferable. But to give an idea: Q1/Q2 of 2022 is fine.

You might have (many) questions to get a clear picture about this project. We like to hear them and answer them to the best of our knowledge. It is very important for us to have a common understanding about the work to avoid wrong expectations from either side. In your reply we like to read about your previous experience, and how you are going to make a succes of this project. We would also appreciate a first indication of the estimated project costs.

If after reading this project description you feel just as exited as we are, we would love to hear from you! ",44

Annotate map image and add captions to images for proposal document,"Hi, I'm looking for someone to finalize the graphics for a proposal to be sent to a potential client. I will send the materials after reviewing portfolios. So for now, just give a ballpark estimate for the initial bid. (If you prefer to do this on an hourly basis that is possible. By the way, the average hourly rate shown is not representative because several of my previous contracts involved lawyers!)

Note that this does not involve detailed graphics editing to create new content. Instead you will be making a few enhancements to existing images.

The main work will be to annotate an existing map to highlight why there are problems in the client's current location. This will involve the following steps:
- Add six phrases (e.g., ""waste"" and ""more waste"") in large prominent font.
- Impose image for nearby business (e.g., the review summary from Google Maps),
- Add a few icons to make more intuitive (e.g., dump trucks).
I'll supply all the images, so you will be mainly combining them and adding text.

You will also create a separate version of the map with space for 'from' and 'to' addresses. The result will be formatted so that it fits on the front of a 8x11"" envelop. It will also be used inside as a glossy attachment (full page).

The other graphics work will just involve adding captions to images for incorporation into a document. This should be editable with Microsoft Word, but PDF would be fine.

Summary of work:
1. Full-sized annotated Google Map of business location w/ a few textual annotations and icons.
2. Reduced version including 'from' and 'to' address text annotations
   [to be printed on full-sized envelop sticker paper].
3. 2 pages of half-page attachments: 2 maps and 2 search results.
4. 1 full-page attachment: web search results in landscape mode
   [to be printed on full-sized envelop sticker paper].
Note: 1 is the main task; 2 is slight variation of 1, and, 3 & 4 involve adding captions to existing images.

Dropshipping - Transfer mapping from Oberlo account to DSers account,"Hello,

DISCLAIMER :)

I'm not looking for someone to deal with my orders or any fulfillments tasks or mapping the products.

I'm looking for someone who can solve my syncing issue between Oberlo & DSers


Here's the situation : there is a Shopify store using Oberlo to do drosphipping.

Now the store uses DSers.

But all the mapping is missing.

The sync button has been used (this one https://ibb.co/vPhytVT) but most of the products have not been synced (like 99%).

There's a explanation message mentioning the potential causes of the non-sync (this one https://ibb.co/Gtjmypv).

The issue is that it's impossible that those reasons lead to 99% not being synced.

In order to filter out low-quality freelancers, please start your application message by “OBERLO2DSERS”. If you don't, you will drastically reduce your chances.

Indeed, a freelancer who will have taken the time to read thoroughly this job description is what we are looking for.

Also, please ask the questions you may have and make an offer (I put 50$ for the sake of having an offer but I'm open to the discussion).

Looking forward to reading your application message!

P.S. : I will provide the Loom I shared with DSers chat support to the people who will apply ""correctly"".

Interactive map for a website. Responsive. ,"We need to find someone who can help us build an interactive map for a brand. The map would look and feel something like this.

https://bitsummit.org/gaiden-map/

The idea is that each ""category"" of products is an island on a map. You can click on the map and it will take you to a regular section. The map is just the initial interaction.  So let's say we have 4 categories (islands). Chocolate, candy, sour and spicy.

North island is chocolate.
South island is candy.
etc....


When you put your mouse on the Chocolate Island, there may be some interaction like an animation or a title showing up, or something. But when you click on it, it will simply go to the regular chocolate products category. So all the interaction is within the map.

In the example you can zoom in and out and drag left and right.  This is fine, but not necessarily what we want.

The big things are

- The map and island should stack in mobile version. In this example the map does not stack. It reacts like a regular map that you can still drag to navigate. The one we need requires responsiveness.
- Big focus on performance. The example I think uses SVGs. The faster it loads, the better.
- The interactive map will live in a Wordpress site. This doesnt mean we need you to build a plugin. We can setup the code within a container, and have it call whatever JS we need. But it must live in a Wordpress site.
- We will provide graphics.

The project is still in early stage. But we need to find the right person first, so we can start the project with the right foot.

If you can find an example that you think is similar to what we are looking for, and you think you can do, you may also provide it.

We are looking for someone who can code this map, basically.

We need a person, an estimated budget. Proof that you can take us where we need. We will go with hourly rate so you can get paid weekly and we can make/see progress.


Good luck.",20
